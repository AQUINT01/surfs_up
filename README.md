## Overview of the Analysis:
After vacationing in Hawaii you decided to relocate to the island of Oahu to pursue surfing.  In an effort to earn an income, you have come up with an idea to open a Surf n' Shake shop to offer surf-boards and ice cream to locals and tourists. You have approached a reputable investor, W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing with your business plan.  W. Avy likes your business idea but expressed concern for the weather conditions in the island.  He is aware of your abilities to analyze data and asks if you could run some analytics on the weather dataset for Oahu. Motivated to get his backing, you set out to provide temperature information for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the Surf n' Shake shop  is sustainable througout the year. 



## Results: 
The study focused on temperature recordings for the months of June and December from 2010 - 2017 for the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The statistical analysis presented below is based from a total of 3,217 temperature records, 1,700  in June and 1,517 in December. 

### June & December Temperature Stats  ![June & December Temperature Stats](https://github.com/AQUINT01/surfs_up/blob/main/images/june_dec_temps_stats.png)


-  On average Oahu's temperatures were strikely similar for both months, 75 C for June and 71 C for December.

-  Temperatures greater than 70 degrees fell within the 75th percentile for both June and December. This indicated the island of Oahu had a moderate warm climate year-around from 2010 - 2017.

-  Similarly, both months yielded max temperatures in the low 80s and cooler min temperatures ranging between 64 and 56 degrees.

## Summary: 
Overall, Oahu has a constant temperature pattern throughout the year with slightly differences in temperatures but nothing drastic to cause an alarm.  If these past temperatures are any indication of future results and based on the analysis, it would be lucrative for W. Avy to consisder investing in the Surf 'n Shake shop. The stable warmer temperatures would sustain the busines model.

However, these results are a snapshot of only two months out of the year.  Is this enough? Studies have proven that hot weather leads to sharp sale increases for ice cream.  However with temperametal weather, ice cream sales can be susceptiable to sharp dips when the summers and winters are cooler or colder. 

To seal W. Avy's investment, it would be wise to provide further studies such as;

  - Running a regressional analysis between temperatures and ice cream sales,
  - Creating queries for other locations with similar temperatures to Oahu, Hawaii, 
  - and presenting these findings in a scatter diagram to illustrate the results.
